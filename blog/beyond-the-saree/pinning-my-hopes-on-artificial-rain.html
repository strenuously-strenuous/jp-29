              <p>
                Today, I again smoked 30 cigarettes. Breathing in the Delhi air around this time of the year is equivalent to this. When wearing a mask, I might smoke “only” 15. Every year around Diwali, when fireworks are set off and fires are lit outside for warmth, and the farmers burning their leftover crops to be able to start a new planting, the air becomes terribly polluted. I count down my hours before boarding the plane to Landour, which is in northern state of Uttarakhand, where the air is fresh.

 
              </p>
              <p>
                This pollution was the reason for me to return to the Netherlands in 2015. About four weeks before my departure, the newspapers reported that the Real Time Air Quality Check (AQI) had reached 225¹. At the time, that was already shockingly high. To put that in perspective: the AQI in Amsterdam reaches 5, and in London it is no more than 2.


              </p>
              <p>
                As a mother of three, it was no longer justifiable to live in such a polluted city. And if you have the option to leave, why not? A month later, I was cycling along Amsterdam’s canals together with my brood, the sun on my face and fresh air to breathe. 



              </p>
              <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Can’t live with it, can’t get away from it



              </h5>
    
              <p>
                My Indian colleagues and their children, on the other hand, are trapped. Currently, all schools are closed due to extreme air pollution, and playing outside is also impossible. This sitting indoors for fear of what is outside looks like a repeat of the COVID period, with the major difference that back then — for the first time (!) — people saw a blue sky. Looking outside now, you see (and smell) the grey thick fog.


              </p>
              <p>
                The father-in-law of one of my team members has chronic asthma and is condemned to sit on top of the air purifier. Another team member’s little son was in intensive care last year because of infected lungs due to pollution. The rest of us have daily headaches, a smoker’s cough and a nagging throat infection. Despite poor sleep, burning eyes and black water when you wash your hands, we are doing our best to cope with the situation.

              </p>

              <p>
                What does it do to a person when one is surrounded by air pollution that cannot be ignored?


              </p>
              
              <p>
                In fact, very little. My daughter, who grew up in Delhi and is here again for a short period with me as we pass through to our next destination in India. She hasn’t seen her Indian friends for a long time, and before she’s flying out, they want to meet up.  Obviously, I would like to tell her to stay home, to stay safe, breathing in the cleaner air streaming out of the hard-working air purifiers, but  unfortunately life goes on. Keeping physical discomfort aside, it is frankly an unreal experience: watching that thick smoke curtain descending, over the city, folding menacingly around houses and buildings and everything else it encounters, dissipating into a cloud of ash that also remains palpably on your skin. Today the AQI in Delhi stands at 500, and by December it will have reached 999 – but that’s because the measurement has only three digits.


              </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                You would think that — as with COVID — people would wear special masks. Nothing could be further from the truth. First, they are not free and are even too expensive for many, but secondly, people either wilfully ignore the situation or are unaware of the dangers. In fact, plenty of people still drive around in their cars with their windows open. Using the car’s air conditioner would be too cold in this season of the year, so to avoid fogging up the windscreen, there seems to be nothing to do but drive with the window open, a simple act that we take for granted but which in the capital poses a health threat.




              </p>
              
              <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">The approach to reducing emissions



              </h5>
              <p>
                Looking back at 2020 and 2021, I remember that the reduced emissions had an immediate effect on the air-pollution situation. That in itself is not a new fact, but the approach to reducing emissions in India is often confused. The farmers around Delhi are largely blamed for the problem as they burn the remains of their crops rather than collect it for compost. However, these farmers are in between a rock and a hard place when it comes to disposing of this material: they are too poor to buy machinery so they must do this process by hand, which can take several weeks; burning it takes just a few days. Because the government releases water for such a short period (15 days) between October and November, these farmers have no time between the summer harvest and winter planting to deal with composting, so they have to burn it. Then, too, when there is no wind in the city – as is the case – the smog lingers over the capital.




              </p>
            </article>
    
            </div>
  

            <article>
              <p>
                Although a better world starts with yourself,: a colleague complained to me how unfair it was, that the farmers were allowed to burn their leftover harvest but fireworks can’t be set off on Diwali because of pollution concerns. The citizens of Delhi also weren’t really thrilled with the “odd-even” rule for cars, where the cars with “even” license plates may be driven on one day and cars with “odd” license places on the next. As a result, that rule was revised and the city is getting dirtier by the day.

              </p>

              <p>
                And so I too have pinned all my hopes on the planned artificial rain. An article in the Financial Times on 17 November² detailed the Indian government’s plan to inject salts or silver iodide into the clouds from a plane so that it will rain. Although last week, it did rain for two days — courtesy of Mother Nature — and this brought temporary relief, for permanent solutions one has to take much stronger and bolder steps. 


              </p>

              <p>
                And given that interfering with nature is not the best thing to do, I now cling to what an elderly gentleman who was born and raised in Delhi recently told me, that two negatives (1) humans add too much pollution in the atmosphere and 2) interfering with nature by creating artificial rain), can sometimes make one positive.


              </p>

                I've always loved to write. In my professional 
                capacity, I engage in creating content for annual

                  but my true passion is to write about topics that occupy me in everyday life.
                  As Managing Director of a leadership-communication agency in India, 
                  I am privileged to lead an exceptional team that is inspiring and 
                  still growing. I work and live half of the year in Delhi which allows 
                  me to experience local life with a depth and intimacy that is afforded 
                  few ex-pats; I share many of my experiences and personal thoughts on 
                  my blogs that are hopefully helpful to many others.
