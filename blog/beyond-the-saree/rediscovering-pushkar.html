              <p>
                It has been at least eight years since I have been to Pushkar. It lies in romantically coloured Rajasthan, about ten kilometres northwest of Ajmer and about a three-hour drive from the big city Jaipur. It is the oldest town in India and is known for its many temples, sacred lake and camel fair. The city is exclusively vegetarian and alcohol-free, with exceptions here and there to keep tourists happy, which is what Pushkar ultimately relies on.


              </p>
              <p>

                And it needs tourists now more than ever. The COVID years were not easy for locals, leaving merchants and catering establishments trying to increase their sales, which affects friendliness and tranquillity. Years ago, the narrow shopping streets of Pushkar were cosy and quiet spaces where shopkeepers quietly conducted trade; now, these streets are noisy and claustrophobic with scooters laden with goods recklessly manoeuvring between the shoppers with unnerving haste. 



              </p>
              <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">‘Sweet memories’
              </h5>
              <p>
                I remember Pushkar as a peaceful town with very friendly inhabitants where I escaped my busy city life in Delhi. It was a place where I could soak up the smells of camels and desert sand, a village where my children could quietly — and safely — browse handmade jewellery and gadgets. We visited regularly, and people welcomed us warmly every year as they started to recognise us. We were invited into their homes, where I was offered chai and my girls received a sweet snack. 
              </p>


              <p>
                Every year, Pushkar was something to look forward to, and as soon as the summer holidays started, we would drive out in the early morning hours. By evening, we would enjoy dal makhani at one of the many rooftop terraces where three tables with plastic chairs were enough to constitute a restaurant, all of which overlooked the holy lake. Pushkar was the only town in the far reaches of Delhi, about a nine-hour drive away, that could offer this. 

              </p>

        
              
              <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">‘Puskhar 2.0’

              </h5>
              <p>
                Those rooftop terraces are still there — still basic but redecorated. More luxurious and cleaner restaurants have been added (most of the basic restaurants always feel a bit shabby), some of which even serve alcohol and make me feel as if I were in Ibiza. It is perhaps for this reason that I was a little shocked by how Pushkar is now: commercialised. 


                
                
              </p>

          <article>
            <p>
              It may well be that it was always like this but I now experience it differently, having arrived here from the organised Netherlands rather than from the always-overwhelming Delhi. I sense that, because of my lifestyle back home — so organised and comfortable —, I can no longer enjoy this town in the same way I once did.


              
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In Delhi, my life was a challenge every day. Getting from A to B was time-consuming, managing the daily work of the house staff was a chore, getting around in traffic without losing your temper was a task, and braving the heat was a victory. Apart from the hot sun on my skin being even hotter in Rajasthan than in Delhi, Pushkar was a haven where I didn’t have to be preoccupied with those kinds of stimuli. Those pleasures seem less accessible now that I have different expectations and needs because of my predictable life in the Netherlands. 



              
              
            </p>
            
            <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">‘Discovery through rediscovery’


              
            </h5>
              <p>
                However, it allows me to discover the other facets of Pushkar. For the first time since I came here, I have the time and energy to take Rajasthani cooking classes, I have joined yoga classes, and my daughter and I went on an organised hike outside the city, visiting almost all the temples. I take pictures of scenes that were then normal to me but are now a treasure to observe. 


                
                
              </p>
              
              <p>
                More than a decade ago, I was occupied with discovering those parts of India that welcomed my energy, naïveté, adventurousness and rebelliousness; now, I go looking for silence and serenity in the simple things here, and I’m able to connect with myself in ways I could never have imagined in the past. 


                
              </p>
              
              <p>
                India always has — and will always have — something to offer for everyone as long as they understand themselves well enough to know where to look.

                  I am privileged to lead an exceptional team that is inspiring and

                  me to experience local life with a depth and intimacy that is afforded 
                  few ex-pats; I share many of my experiences and personal thoughts on 
                  my blogs that are hopefully helpful to many others.
